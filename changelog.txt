" require.vim
"
" Defining Require command (like expression) and Require() function.
"
" The Require Command will import a vim module/file/plugin
"
" The Require() Function will import the module, and return s:exports in
" that module
"
" NOTE:
" .vim or .vimrc
" This is defining, not funcion,
" so no need to source the whole vimrc
" so, just use '.vim'
"
" DONE:
" 'require' need throw an error when module not found
"
" NOTE: the '%:p' in require.vim script's function
" will be the require.vim's path. so we pass a <sfile> in.
"
" DONE:
" source file of dirs with following sequence.
"   relative dir
"   relative dir and it's all parent's modules/ directory: if got one.
"   vim-box's dir
"   vim runtime
"
" DONE:
" Avoid recursive chain requiring
"
" DONE:
" merge s:require and Require
"
" NOTE: This file is in vim-box/lib
"
" XXX
"   We should not use cache, or cache for $VIMRUNTIME only,
"   as it will not load relative modules.
" SOLVED:
"   use full path not module name as key (s:modules)
"   and then removed chain name
"
" DONE:
" the file name include '..' is not normalized.
" if exists("s:is_loaded") 
"     finish
" else 
"     let s:is_loaded = 1
" endif
" let s:dot_dir = expand('<sfile>:p:h')

" Require for command
